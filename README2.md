AMETHST, or Analysis METHod Selection Tool, is an automated pipeline that makes it possible to objectively assess the relative performance of multiple analysis methods applied to annotation abundance data. Utilizing objective, permutation-based statistics, it can determine the best performing analysis from any arbitrary collection of analyses, and can also determine the degree to which each analysis step (e.g. normalization and reprocessing of the data, selection of distance/dissimilarity metric) affects the results produced by each analysis method.
